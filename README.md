# Intro
Hi! This is just a small project I took on to learn how to build things using code. 

I specifically chose tom nake a Todo-list application as I'm getting heavy into life optimizations and utilizing programs like Notion to manage my work flow.

I wanted this project to end up with a ui, so I developed it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

### html
The html provides structure of the web page. It's in charge of setting the:
- input: A text field where users can type in new tasks.
- button: a button to add tasks to the list
- ul: an unordered list that will contain the tasks

### CSS
- Styles the appearance of the web page

### Javascript
Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page.
- addTask() Function: Handles the process of adding new tasks to the list.
- Fetches Input Value: Retrieves the task text from the input field.
- Checks for Empty Input: Ensures that tasks are not empty.
- Creates List Item: Creates a new list item (<li>) with the task text.
- Appends Task: Adds the new task to the <ul> element.
- Clears Input Field: Resets the input field for the next task.


# Remarks
I know this is all simple stuff but it was definitely a huge learning curve. Wish I documented the learning process, it took me a couple weeks to get this all working, the biggest thing is I didn't know what I didn't know. Now that I got the ball rolling, I'm excited to add some more features.

# Future Implementations
- A delete button to get rid of tasks in the ul
- A mark as complete button
